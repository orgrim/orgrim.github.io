It appeared that pg_back could be a good candidate projet to let me learn Go. This is why pg_back version 2 is written in Go.\nGo can do better than shell scripting, like many languages, but one helpful feature of Go is that it produces static binaries. This make it even easier to install than the shell script, because pg_back no longer has any external dependencies, apart from pg_dump and pg_dumpall. When one does not have root privileges, it make it possible be deploy the binary file by dropping it somewhere like one would do for a shell script.\nAbout the rewrite, getting rid of dependencies on external command is great. For example, the syntax of Go being close to C, it was quite easy to port pg_dumpacl and integrate it directly in pg_back. It is now just two function dumpCreateDBAndACL() and makeACLCommands() in sql.go.\nContinuing on external commands, pg_back now connects to PostgreSQL without using psql, with the native database/sql API. The standard library is pretty rich, it allowed the use standard Go APIs for checksums, file locking, logging, etc. Only 4 external modules are required, plus one for unit tests:\n gopkg.in/ini.v1 for the configuration file github.com/spf13/pflag for POSIX command line options github.com/lib/pq to access PostgreSQL github.com/anmitsu/go-shlex to parse shell commands (mostly hooks)  The other module is github.com/google/go-cmp, with is useful to compare structs in unit tests. Speaking of which, unit tests are native to Go, and it was easy to add tests while developping. The difficult part of unit testing is related to the replication control functions. Unit testing the replication control fonctions is difficult because it requires a more complex setup. We need a PostgreSQL instance with a replica.\nThis feature is interesting, because I could use some features of Go to implement pausing the replication.\nWhen dumping from a replica, we need to ensure pg_dump won’t be stuck on an exclusive lock, we must pause the replication replay to avoid pg_dump being cancelled and there must not be any exclusive lock granted on an object when the replication is paused. Otherwise the exclusive lock is only released when replication replay is resumed, making the dump of the object impossible.\nI used a go routine with a time.Ticker to try to pause the replication every 10 seconds:\nfunc pauseReplicationWithTimeout(db *pg, timeOut int) error { // ...  ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Duration(10) * time.Second) done := make(chan bool) stop := make(chan bool) fail := make(chan error) l.Infoln(\"pausing replication\") // We want to retry pausing replication at a defined interval  // but not forever. We cannot put the timeout in the same  // select as the ticker since the ticker would always win  go func() { var rerr *pgReplicaHasLocks defer ticker.Stop() for { if err := pauseReplication(db); err != nil { if errors.As(err, \u0026rerr) { l.Warnln(err) } else { fail  err return } } else { done  true return } select { case stop: return case ticker.C: break } } }() // ... } When there is an exclusive lock, a custom error is used to inform the goroutine that it must retry:\ntype pgReplicaHasLocks struct{} func (*pgReplicaHasLocks) Error() string { return \"replication not paused because of AccessExclusiveLock\" } func pauseReplication(db *pg) error { // ..  if void == \"failed\" { return \u0026pgReplicaHasLocks{} } return nil } The main goroutine just wait on some channel until there is a timeout using time.After(), replication has been paused or an error occured:\n// ... (After lauching the goroutine)  // Return as soon as the replication is paused or stop the  // goroutine if we hit the timeout  select { case done: l.Infoln(\"replication paused\") case time.After(time.Duration(timeOut) * time.Second): stop  true return fmt.Errorf(\"replication not paused after %v\", time.Duration(timeOut)*time.Second) case err := fail: return fmt.Errorf(\"%s\", err) } // ... See the complete function in sql.go#L509-L629.\nAnother use of goroutines was to run pg_dump commands concurrently, in order to dump many database at the same time. It uses the worker example from gobyexample.com, a great ressource for beginners, by the way!\nThe other problems with shell scripting were about parsing strings, like keyword=value connection strings of PostgreSQL (connstring.go). Shell scripting is notoriously difficult when it comes to handling strings properly, and Go helped a lot. It was happily surprised that the Go implementation of pg_back could dump databases with weird characters in their names, like the equal sign, spaces, quotes, etc. without a lot of extra work.\nFinally, the embed feature of Go 1.16 is so easy to use that embeding the default configuration file, including examples and comments, and adding a command line option to print it took a just few lines of code:\nimport ( // ...  _ \"embed\" // ... ) //go:embed pg_back.conf var defaultCfg string func parseCli(args []string) (options, []string, error) { // ...  pflag.BoolVar(\u0026pce.ShowConfig, \"print-default-config\", false, \"print the default configuration\\n\") if pce.ShowConfig { fmt.Print(defaultCfg) // ...  } // ... } This will make the feature easier to maintain in the future because it avoids duplication, as I would have had to copy the file in a string in the source code without embed.\nIn conclusion, rewriting pg_back in a proper programming language with a rich standard library and ecosystem was great. I enjoyed doing it with Go and it convinced me that Go is programming language worth learning.\n",

      How Go helped for the rewrite of pg_back

  <div class="post-content">
<p>When I started developping <a href="https://github.com/orgrim/pg_back">pg_back</a>, I
wanted to keep it a simple as possible, by limiting its features. It also
limited contributions, and at some point by accepting some useful
contributions, the script grew and became not so simple. We could go on with
the shell script and try to carefully control its growth, but it will sooner or
later reach some limits of shell scripting.</p>
<p>After some time without making it evolve, I got interested in the Go
programming language. It appeared that pg_back could be a good candidate projet
to let me learn Go. This is why pg_back version 2 is written in Go.</p>
<p>Go can do better than shell scripting, like many languages, but one helpful
feature of Go is that it produces static binaries. This make it even easier to

<a href="https://github.com/orgrim/pg_back/blob/master/sql.go">sql.go</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing on external commands, pg_back now connects to PostgreSQL without
using <code>psql</code>, with the native <code>database/sql</code> API. The standard library is
pretty rich, it allowed the use standard Go APIs for checksums, file locking,
logging, etc. Only 4 external modules are required, plus one for unit tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gopkg.in/ini.v1</code> for the configuration file</li>
<li><code>github.com/spf13/pflag</code> for POSIX command line options</li>
<li><code>github.com/lib/pq</code> to access PostgreSQL</li>
<li><code>github.com/anmitsu/go-shlex</code> to parse shell commands (mostly hooks)</li>
</ul>
<p>The other module is <code>github.com/google/go-cmp</code>, with is useful to compare
structs in unit tests. Speaking of which, unit tests are native to Go, and it
was easy to add tests while developping. The difficult part of unit testing is

10 seconds:</p>

<p>Another use of goroutines was to run <code>pg_dump</code> commands concurrently, in order to dump many
database at the same time. It uses the worker example from
<a href="https://gobyexample.com/worker-pools">gobyexample.com</a>, a great ressource for
beginners, by the way!</p>
<p>The other problems with shell scripting were about parsing strings, like
<code>keyword=value</code> connection strings of PostgreSQL
(<a href="https://github.com/orgrim/pg_back/blob/master/connstring.go">connstring.go</a>). Shell
scripting is notoriously difficult when it comes to handling strings properly,
and Go helped a lot. It was happily surprised that the Go implementation of pg_back
could dump databases with weird characters in their names, like the equal sign,
spaces, quotes, etc. without a lot of extra work.</p>
<p>Finally, the embed feature of Go 1.16 is so easy to use that embeding the
default configuration file, including examples and comments, and adding a
command line option to print it took a just few lines of code:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>This will make the feature easier to maintain in the future because it avoids
duplication, as I would have had to copy the file in a string in the source
code without <code>embed</code>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, rewriting pg_back in a proper programming language with a rich
standard library and ecosystem was great. I enjoyed doing it with Go and it
convinced me that Go is programming language worth learning.</p>
