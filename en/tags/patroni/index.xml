      <description>Recently I found a missing feature in Patroni, a high availability solution for PostgreSQL written in Python.
Since I am doing more Python at work these days, I quickly made a patch. Before jumping on git push, I thought it would be nice to test if is really solves the issue. I needed a Patroni cluster, some configuration is provided and commands in the README, which is great but the instruction are not targetted toward development.</description>
